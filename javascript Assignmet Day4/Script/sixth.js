
// Question 6:
// Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
// The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
// Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a specialhandling for a non-numeric input in this task.

console.log("Loop Program")
let num;
do{
    num =prompt("Enter a number greater than 100 / empty space to cancel Input",0);
}
while (num <= 100 && num);
